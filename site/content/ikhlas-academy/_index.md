# Ikhlas Academy Main

## Welcome to Ikhlas Academy / Sunday School Page

We are here, all praise and thanks is due to Allah, for the education and development of Muslim youth ages 5-18. All cultures, backgrounds, and knowledge levels are encouraged to enroll in order to benefit from our dedicated and talented teachers and staff.

Our goal is to foster a sense of belonging and inclusion for each and every student at Ikhlas Academy, while building on their Islamic knowledge. We hope to educate our youth about our Deen and also help them navigate Western society while holding on to their Muslim identity with pride. AlhamdullilAllah, we have educated and knowledgeable teachers with great character and values who know first-hand what it's like to grow up in this society as a Muslim.

We feel that in this day and age, one of the most important things is to keep our youth close to the masjid and community. We want to hear from them about their struggles, counsel them in their hardships and provide an environment where they can build memories with fellow Muslim friends and mentors.
